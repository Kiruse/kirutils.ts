# @kiruse/utils
This repository & package harbors various utilities that I don't quite know yet where to put. Even worse, some of this functionality, like the scheduler, only works with bun, currently. Sub-libraries in this repository still need to be further refined into useful standalone libraries. But until then, it's nice to be able to just `npm i` this library in my own projects.
